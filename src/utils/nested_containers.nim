## Helper function to get the dimensions of nested arrays/sequences
# Dimension check is using only the first nested element so further checking
# must be one to confirm that the total number of elements match the dimensions.

## Flatten any-depth nested sequences.
# TODO support array/openarray. Pending https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/2652
