proc asContiguous*[T](t: Tensor[T]{call}, layout: OrderType = rowMajor, force: bool = false): Tensor[T] {.inline.}=
  ## Transform a tensor with general striding to a Tensor with contiguous layout.
  ##
  ## By default tensor will be rowMajor.
  ##
  ## By default nothing is done if the tensor is already contiguous (C Major or F major)
  ## The "force" parameter can force re-ordering to a specific layout
  ##
  ## This is a move optimization for function chaining to avoid copying value returned by the previous function

  ## TODO, find a way to test that (global counter  for testing?)
  # echo "Value moved"
