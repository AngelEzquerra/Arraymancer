  ## Transform a tensor with general striding to a Tensor with contiguous layout.
  ##
  ## By default tensor will be rowMajor.
  ##
  ## By default nothing is done if the tensor is already contiguous (C Major or F major)
  ## The "force" parameter can force re-ordering to a specific layout
  ##
  ## This is a move optimization for function chaining to avoid copying value returned by the previous function

  ## Permute dimensions of a tensors
  ## Input:
  ##   - a tensor
  ##   - the new dimension order
  ## Returns:
  ##   - a tensor with re-order dimension
  ## Usage:
  ##  .. code:: nim
  ##     a.permute(0,2,1) # dim 0 stays at 0, dim 1 becomes dim 2 and dim 2 becomes dim 1
