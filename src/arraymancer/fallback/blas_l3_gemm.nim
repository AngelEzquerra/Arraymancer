# The following code is heavily inspired by ulmBLAS (http://apfel.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/~lehn/ulmBLAS/)
# which is heavily inspired by BLIS (https://github.com/flame/blis)
# A big difference (for now?) is instead of passing (const) pointers I pass the (var) array and a var offset.

#### TODO:
# - OpenMP parallelization
# {.passl: "-fopenmp".} # Issue: Clang OSX does not support openmp
# {.passc: "-fopenmp".} # and the default GCC is actually a link to Clang

# - Loop unrolling  # Currently Nim `unroll` pragma exists but is ignored.
# - Pass `-march=native` to the compiler
# - Align memory # should be automatic
# - Is there a way to get L1/L2 cache size at compile-time
# - Is there a way to get number of registers at compile-time
