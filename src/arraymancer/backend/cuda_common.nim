# This file is included for all compilation target (Cpu, CUDA, ...) so that typeclass AnyTensor works properly
# Data structure to ease interfacing with Cuda
type
  CudaSeq*[T: SomeReal] = object
    ## Cuda-Seq like structure
    ## End goal is for it to have value semantics like Nim seq
    ## and optimize to not copy if referenced only once
    len: int
    data: ptr array[0,T]
